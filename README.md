# Proletarian - The not so rich text editor
Proletarian is a simple(st) and tiny rich text editor. It aims to add just basic functionality as bold, italics and lists.

# Demo
A basic demonstration can be found at the project page: http://reu.github.com/proletarian

# Disclaimer
For now, this is just a toy project which I used to learn some basics of coffesscript and jasmine, so, don't expect too much.
